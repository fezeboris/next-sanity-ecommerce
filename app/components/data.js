    content: `Good course, I really enjoyed it! The teacher does a good job explaining both the fundamental and the complex concepts step by step in the simplest way. Many computer vision applications are covered such as image classification, segmentation and generation. I particularly liked the Vision Transformers videos because those are state of the art architectures!`,

    content: `Amazing course! It really is practical The Malaria detection project gives a good understanding of CNNs and goes through the complete workflow of a ML project.  There are also other CV projects such as Image segmentation, people counting generation and so on.
      The teacher makes complex concepts simple. I really enjoyed every minute of the course, it is worth it!`,

      Going from the most basic concepts to the more advanced, this course provides a clear and well structured methodology to approach Deep learning problems. All explained in a comprehensive way which makes it accessible to beginners. I really appreciated the different applications. That was a great course taught by a great instructor. Highly recommended!`,

      What a great course. I was expecting this to be more of an introduction to high level concepts in computer vision using Tensorflow. Instead it is an incredibly well explained and detailed course on how to build end to end state of art computer vision solutions. `,

      I'd recommend this course to anyone (like myself) who wants to get started with practical nlp. 
      The course strikes a good balance between teaching the details of how transformers work and how we can tackle problems using huggingface transformers. `,
